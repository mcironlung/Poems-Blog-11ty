Sailing, for me, embodies a freedom that's hard to find on solid ground. It's as if, with every voyage, I shed the weight of the world and become a true sailor, heart bound to the endless blue.

There's a certain magic in how the winds converse with the sails, a language older than time, whispered across the water's surface. It's here, amidst the ocean's vast embrace, that I find a clarity, a simplicity that eludes us in our cluttered lives.

The water, with its rhythms and moods, has become a canvas for my thoughts, a mirror reflecting the vastness of the world and the depths within ourselves. Each journey is a poem written by the union of sailor, wind, and wave, a story that unfolds with the unfurling of sails and the charting of unseen paths.

In these moments, carried by the winds, dancing atop the waves, I'm reminded of the sheer expanse of life and the beauty of moving forward, propelled by forces seen and unseen. Sailing isn't just an escape; it's a return to what's essential, a way to navigate not just the ocean, but our lives, with grace, courage, and a sense of adventure.

## 7 Poems About Sailing

### Valerie's Voyage: Harmony of Sail and Soul
------------------------------------------

This is a poem I wrote about myself in the 3rd person.  It's a little different for me, but I wanted to try it.

> On gentle waves where whispers breeze,  
> Valerie finds her sweetest ease.  
> Aboard her vessel, swift and sure,  
> Life's simplest pleasures she procures.
> 
> The bow cuts through the ocean's hymn,  
> Where futures bright and pasts grow dim.  
> The stern, a guardian of her wake,  
> Holds stories of the path she'll take.
> 
> The mainsail rises, proud and tall,  
> Catching dreams, she hears the call.  
> Jib unfurled, in dance with wind,  
> Guiding where her hopes are pinned.
> 
> The keel, her steadiness beneath,  
> Guides her through the waters' teeth.  
> Rudder's touch, a subtle steer,  
> Bringing distant horizons near.
> 
> On deck, she finds her freedom's breath,  
> A sailor's heart, no fear of death.  
> The boom swings, a rhythm set free,  
> Harmony of the sea and she.
> 
> In this world of water and wind,  
> Valerie's spirit is unchinned.

> On endless seas, a vast explore.
> 
> Each part, a role in life's grand play,  
> On this stage, she finds her way.

### Casting Sails: The Courage to Depart
------------------------------------

> In the harbor of hesitation, beneath white clouds' contemplation,  
> Lies a vessel, dreams in its keel, yearning for the ocean's feel.  
> With sails unfurled, the journey beckons—  
> A path unseen, a soul reckons.
> 
> Grey mist cloaks the dawn's first light,  
> A shroud of fear, the unknown's might.  
> Yet, within this haze of doubt's creation,  
> Lies the spark of liberation.
> 
> For every sailor knows this truth,  
> That courage isn't in the youth  
> Of journeys made 'neath skies so clear,  
> But in those steps when clouds are near.
> 
> The first step, oh, the hardest throw,  
> Against the wind, where fears might grow.  
> Yet, with this act, the mist does part,  
> Revealing the strength within one's heart.
> 
> Casting sails, the courage to depart,  
> Not in absence of fear, but in its art.  
> For in this choice to face the unknown,  
> We find the way our souls have grown.
> 
> Across the water's vast expanse,  
> Under white clouds' watchful glance,  
> The grey mist clears, and in its wake,  
> The journey's path we dare to take.
> 
> So let us cast our sails on high,  
> Beneath the vast, embracing sky.  
> For it's in leaving shore behind,  
> We discover the truths we're meant to find.

### Stars as Guides: Navigating by the Night
----------------------------------------

> In the vast expanse where the night unfurls its cloak,  
> Beneath the turbulent skies, our hopes awoke.  
> Guided not by sight, but by heart's quiet plea,  
> We set our course where the dark waters meet eternity.
> 
> Troubled waters with tales of old,  
> Of sailors bold, and secrets untold.  
> Yet amidst the chaos of the night's embrace,  
> The stars above guide us with their grace.
> 
> With every wave that dances with the moon's light,  
> And every gust that challenges our plight,  
> We find solace in the celestial guides, serene,  
> A path illuminated, where fear has never been.
> 
> In the sky’s vast kingdom, where dreams take flight,  
> Our spirits soar, carried by the winds of night.  
> For even in the darkest hours, when shadows cast their lies,  
> We're steered by the stars, the ancient allies.
> 
> Through turbulent skies and the storms we brave,  
> Our course is constant, our resolve unwaveringly grave.  
> For in the canvas of the night, so infinitely wide,  
> We chart our journey by the stars, our eternal guide.
> 
> So let the troubled waters come, let the tempest roar,  
> For within our souls, we hold the lore.  
> Navigating by the night, with the stars' light as our guides,  
> We'll sail beyond the dawn, where true north resides.

### Winds of Change: Embracing Life's Shifts 
-----------------------------------------

> In the heart of the blue ocean wide,  
> Where dreams sail and secrets hide,  
> The winds of change, they guide so soft,  
> Guiding my vessel, aloft and oft.
> 
> Across vast waters, under shifting skies,  
> My spirit dances, my soul flies.  
> With each gust that bends the sail,  
> I learn to live, to weave my tale.
> 
> The world seems grand, of infinite size,  
> Yet in this expanse, my essence lies.  
> Beneath the stars and over the deep,  
> I find the promises I wish to keep.
> 
> For in the grip of the ocean's might,  
> Amidst the storms and the starlit night,  
> I see my life in diminished size,  
> A fleeting moment under the vast, open skies.
> 
> But the winds of change, they carry me,  
> Over the waves, towards destiny.  
> In their embrace, I find my way,  
> Embracing life's shifts, come what may.
> 
> So let the winds blow, let them roar,  
> I'll sail through life, from shore to shore.  
> With each change, I'll find my place,  
> In the vast waters, with grace and space.
> 
> The winds of change, forever near,  
> Teach me to move, without fear.  
> For in this journey, I've come to find,  
> The truest course, laid out by the wind's mind.
