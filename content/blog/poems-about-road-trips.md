Road trips resonate with so many of us because they offer a rare blend of freedom and purpose. The road unfolds in front of us, a ribbon of possibility stretching beyond the horizon. Each mile brings something new: unexpected towns, wide fields, or hidden views glimpsed from a winding pass. Whether we travel alone or with loved ones, the journey becomes a living story we get to write moment by moment. Poetry has a way of capturing this spirit—both the motion and the stillness, the excitement and the introspection. In these verses, you’ll find the essence of what it means to leave home behind, if only for a little while. May these words inspire your next adventure.

### Map Folded Away

This free verse poem explores the idea of letting go of plans and trusting the journey. The structure flows like an uncharted route, winding from thought to thought.

> We stopped pretending we knew the way—  
> folded the map into a soft square  
> and let it slide under the seat.  
>   
> The road didn’t mind our uncertainty,  
> it only asked that we keep moving,  
> that we look up at the sky now and then,  
> measure time by sunsets instead of clocks.  
>   
> Each turn became a small surrender,  
> a lesson in how to arrive  
> without ever being sure  
> where we meant to go.
