### Salt and Skin

This poem explores the sensory richness of a day by the sea. Free verse allows the imagery to spill out in an unstructured, immersive way—like waves rolling onto shore.

> I remember salt crusting my skin,  
> the wind tasting of distant places,  
> the sun pouring molten gold  
> on every inch of sand.  
>   
> We dove beneath green waves  
> that carried our laughter to the horizon,  
> and for a while, we belonged to nothing  
> but the heat and the tide.  
>   
> Even now, when the days grow short,  
> I feel that salt on my lips—  
> proof that summer leaves its trace,  
> a quiet hunger for what once was endless.
